# Things I learned/did today

+ I wasn't able to connect to GitHub (use clone/push) from the home network (India). I am also facing trouble connecting to
  UMBC vision servers. Probably because of the network configuration of my service provider. Looked up a few issues of accessing
  GitHub from a network using proxy/firewall. Didn't fix it. Using Mobile Hotspot data. :D

+ I set up ssh authentication for GitHub on my Dell Inspiron Laptop.
  I followed the steps outlined here [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys/) and didn't face any issues.

+ I learned what RSS (Rich Site Summary) is all about. Read this article [What Everyone Should Know About RSS Feeds](https://www.lifewire.com/rss-101-3482781). Learned about feed readers. Started using Feedly. Bye bye bookmarks! I guess! :D

+ Installed Mendeley Desktop. I will manage my bibliographies from now onwards.

+ Read [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)
