# Things I learned/did today

+ Worked through [One Shot Learning in Siamese Networks in Pytorch](https://hackernoon.com/one-shot-learning-with-siamese-networks-in-pytorch-8ddaab10340e)

+ Implemented [LeNet 5 for MNIST in Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist)

+ Read a tutorial on [lambda functions in python](https://www.python-course.eu/lambda.php)

```python
f = lambda x,y: x+y
```

They are anonymous functions. Take arguments (left of colon) and compute the expression on the right of colon. Examples of
use with map, reduce and filter functions.
