# Today I Learned

This repo is inspired by [erfannoury/TIL](https://github.com/erfannoury/TIL).

Recently, I have realized that there is a lot to learn and so it's no use thinking about how much you currently know. We are constantly learning new things. This is a repo to document my learnings. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences) explaining a new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that I've learned.
